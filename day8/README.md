# Day 8 - O(lots)

Nothing particularly tricky about today for SQL, we can simply convert the map into a table with row, col, element and then do inner queries for each row to calculate part 1 and 2. 

Requires being aware of the rules for null coalescense in psql but that's par for the course. Much easier than day 5 or 7!
